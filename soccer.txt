P0&1 Basic Mechanism
  on Field: Players pass ball to each other
    Player
      can move
      has zone-of-control
        radius
          later consider perspective/vision 
    Ball
      velo
        later + decay
  Opponents attempt to intercept
    Player
      zone-of-control also intercepts
        prob(success) inverse dist(center)
  Continuous space on Field
    Players/Ball register target
    Field calculates event resolution order
      simulate episodes until next event
      then recompute/poll target
P2 Inside Out
  show control/intercept heat-fans
  show safe corridors
